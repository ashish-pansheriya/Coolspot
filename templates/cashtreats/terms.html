<p><strong>7. </strong><strong>Hire a Friend</strong><strong> is a Marketplace; Limitation of Liability</strong></p>
<p>Hire a Friend acts as a marketplace to connect Members who wish to meet one another.&nbsp;<br />
  Specifically, Hire a Friend connects &ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; who may become friends to paid &ldquo;Seekers&rdquo; on the Service. Friends and Seekers are collectively referred to as &ldquo;Members.&rdquo; Friends may sign up for a membership to the Service free of charge, and earn money by acting as friends to Seekers. Seekers may pay a fee to Friends who are willing to become friends to the Members. Friends are able to keep 100% of the money they earn on the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Hire a Friend IS NOT A DATING OR PERSONALS SERVICE. THE PURPOSE OF THE SERVICE IS TO PROVIDE A PLATFORM FOR PLATONIC, NON- SEXUAL, NON-ROMANTIC, NON-PHYSICAL FRIENDSHIPS BETWEEN MEMBERS. THE SERVICE MAY NOT BE USED TO SOLICIT OR CREATE SEXUAL OR PHYSICAL CONTACT BETWEEN MEMBERS, OR IN ANY WAY WHICH OTHERWISE VIOLATES APPLICABLE LAW AND/OR THESE TERMS OF USE. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT USE OF THE SERVICE IN VIOLATION OF THIS PROVISION MAY RESULT IN A VARIETY OF PENALTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION REVOCATION OF YOUR ACCESS TO THE SERVICE.</strong></p>
<p>If a Member contacts or solicits you in a manner which violates this provision, these Terms of Use, applicable law, and/or which makes you feel uncomfortable in any manner, please contact us immediately at info@Hire a Friend. <br />
  You acknowledge and agree that Hire a Friend is not a party to any agreement between you and another Member, and that, as further set forth in Section 20, we are not liable to you for any loss incurred as the result of a Member&rsquo;s acts or omissions, including without limitation failure to communicate, breach of contract, physical injury, death, emotional distress, property damage, conversion, fraud, negligence, and intellectual property violations.</p>
<p>You are solely responsible for your own conduct in using the Service and interacting with other Members. You acknowledge and agree that Hire a Friend does not verify its Members&rsquo; statements or conduct background checks, credit checks, or other inquiries into its Members&rsquo; backgrounds. We cannot verify the veracity of any statements made by our Members. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Hire a Friend reserves the right, but is not obligated, to conduct any background check, sex offender check, or other search or screening, using available public records, in its sole discretion.</p>
<p>If you decide to meet a Member outside of the Service, you acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for taking all necessary safety precautions. You should not give another Member any sensitive personal information, including without limitation financial information, your address, your social security number, or other information which could compromise your safety or financial well-being.</p>
<p>Hire a Friend cannot guarantee the true identity, age, and nationality of any of its Members. Hire a Friend encourages you to communicate directly with Members through the tools available on the Websites.</p>
<p>Hire a Friend DOES NOT CONDUCT BACKGROUND CHECKS ON ANY OF ITS MEMBERS. IT IS SOLELY YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT YOURSELF. IN ADDITION TO FOLLOWING BASIC PRECAUTIONS, PLEASE FAMILIARIZE YOURSELF WITH OUR SAFETY GUIDELINES BEFORE MEETING A MEMBER OUTSIDE OF THE SERVICE:<br />

<p><strong>a.</strong> Always meet in a public place. This is very important, never meet someone you don't know at their house or at a private location. Meeting in public will help both of you feel comfortable<br />
  <br />
  <strong>b.</strong> Always have a phone with you, or some spare change if you need to make a phone call.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>c.</strong>. Always tell your friends where you are going and who you are going with. Leave a contact phone number and name. Tell your friend or family member where you are going and what time you are planning on coming home. It's always good to have one of your friends or family member call at a planned time just so they can check in. Also it's important that the person you are meeting with is aware that your friends/family know where you are.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>d.</strong> Trust your gut instinct. If something doesn't feel right, get out of the situation. Never put yourself in a situation where you are uncomfortable.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>e.</strong> Before you meet someone ask for their photo just so you know what the person looks like before you meet them<br />
  <br />
  <strong>f.</strong> Never have a problem saying &quot;No&quot;. If you are not happy with something, make it clear.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>g.</strong> Remember these are NOT dates you are going on. You are spending time together. There is NO physical contact allowed!<br />
  <br />
  <strong>h.</strong> If you are planning on drinking, don't get drunk. This is just common sense, especially if you are meeting someone for the first time.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>i.</strong> Don't leave any of your belongings unattended. Purse, wallets, jackets, etc. Anything of value should be watched at all times.</p>

    <br />
    Members Contacting Friends</strong></p>

We will never request your home address, or real name. Your email address will never be displayed on the website.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>You acknowledge and agree that your phone number will be provided to Seekers on the Service, and that Seekers may use this information to contact you. <br />

(your email address will never be shared).  Only  paying Members of the website will be able to view your phone number. We  keep full logs of all phone numbers that are viewed.

  Seekers will not have access to your email address unless you provide it to them willingly. For more information, please see this link:<br />
    </strong></p>
<p>In the event that Members encounter a dispute that they cannot resolve among themselves, Hire a Friend will make reasonable efforts to help you reach a resolution. However, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so, and we cannot make any judgment or determination about the facts or law pertaining to the dispute. You acknowledge and agree that Hire a Friend is not under any obligation to help you resolve a dispute.</p>
<p>Although we sincerely hope that you connect with other Members using the Service, you acknowledge and agree that we do not guarantee or promise that you will be compatible with any other Member. Each Member&rsquo;s success using the Service is dependent on a number of factors, many of which are out of Hire a Friend&rsquo;s and/or the relevant Member&rsquo;s control, and Hire a Friend cannot guarantee results to any Member.</p>
<p><strong>8. No Employment or Agency Relationship.</strong></p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that these Terms of Use, and the Privacy Policy, do not create any employment, agency, partnership, or joint venture relationship between you and Hire a Friend.</p>

However, Hire a Friend cannot guarantee that there will be no unauthorized copying or distribution of Your Content nor will Hire a Friend be liable for any copying or usage of Your Content not authorized by Hire a Friend. You hereby release and forever waive any claims you may have against Hire a Friend for any such unauthorized copying or usage of Your Content, under any theory of liability. THE SECURITY MEASURES TO PROTECT YOUR CONTENT USED BY Hire a Friend HEREIN ARE PROVIDED AND USED &quot;AS-IS&quot; AND WITH NO WARRANTIES OR ASSURANCES THAT SUCH SECURITY MEASURES WILL WITHSTAND ATTEMPTS TO EVADE SECURITY MECHANISMS OR THAT THERE WILL BE NO CRACKS, DISABLEMENTS OR OTHER CIRCUMVENTION OF SUCH SECURITY MEASURES.</p>
<p>Hire a Friend may, in our sole discretion, remove any content posted on the Service, for any reason or no reason whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we are not obligated to monitor content uploaded to the Service and we do not guarantee that we will remove any content that violates these Terms of Use or is illegal or otherwise objectionable. </p>
<p>Hire a Friend reserves the right, in our sole discretion, to limit the quantity or method of communications that you may send to other Members within a set period of time.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Without limiting the foregoing, Hire a Friend has the right to cooperate fully with any court or law enforcement agency or authority ordering or requesting that we disclose the identity of, or any other information about, anyone posting any materials on or through the Websites or Service. YOU AGREE TO WAIVE AND HOLD HARMLESS Hire a Friend, ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSEES, AND SERVICE PROVIDERS, FROM ANY CLAIMS RESULTING FROM ANY ACTION TAKEN BY ANY OF THE FOREGOING PARTIES, DURING, IN RESPONSE TO, OR AS A RESULT OF, ITS INVESTIGATIONS, AS WELL AS FROM ANY ACTIONS TAKEN AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SUCH INVESTIGATIONS, WHETHER BY SUCH PARTIES OR BY A COURT OR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY OR AUTHORITY.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, Hire a Friend cannot and does not undertake to review all materials before they are posted on the Websites or Service. Hire a Friend cannot ensure that objectionable material will be promptly removed after it has been posted.</p>
<p>Hire a Friend assumes no liability for any action or inaction taken by us or any of our affiliates, licensees, and/or service providers, regarding content, communications, or transmissions from or by any user or third party.

<p><strong>b. Billing</strong>. Hire a Friend bills you through an online account (your&nbsp;&quot;Billing Account&quot;) for use of the Service. You agree to pay Hire a Friend all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of the Service by you or other persons (including your agents) using your Billing Account, and you authorize Hire a Friend to charge your chosen payment provider (your&nbsp;&quot;Payment Method&quot;) for the Service. You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method. Hire a Friend reserves the right to correct any errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested or received payment.</p>
<p><strong>c. Payment Method.&nbsp;</strong>The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen payment method.</p>
<p><strong>d. Recurring Billing.</strong> Our subscription plans to the Service consist of an initial period, for which there is a one-time charge, followed by recurring period charges as agreed to by you. By entering into this Agreement, you acknowledge that your subscription has an initial and recurring payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation. Hire a Friend may submit periodic charges (e.g. yearly) without further authorization from you, until you provide prior notice (confirmed in writing by Hire a Friend) that you have terminated this authorization or wish to change your payment method. Such notice will not affect charges submitted before Hire a Friend could reasonably act. You may change your payment method or cancel your paid membership by a provider of your chosen Payment Method (the &quot;Payment Method Provider&quot;) by sending us an email at info@Hire a Friend. For your convenience, we take your payment information so that your Hire a Friend membership will not be interrupted. We auto-renew your membership at the level you selected. Your Hire a Friend subscription will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the subscription term originally selected, at the then-current non-promotional subscription rate (if applicable). You may cancel your subscription by sending us an email at info@Hire a Friend. Please note that you will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period.</p>
<p><strong>e. Current Information Required.</strong> YOU MUST PROVIDE CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE INFORMATION FOR YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT.

CHANGES TO SUCH INFORMATION CAN BE MADE AT ACCOUNT SETTINGS. IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE Hire a Friend ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, YOU AGREE THAT Hire a Friend MAY CONTINUE CHARGING YOU FOR ANY USE OF THE SERVICE UNDER YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT UNLESS YOU HAVE TERMINATED YOUR SUBSCRIPTION FOR THE SERVICE (CONFIRMED BY YOU IN WRITING UPON REQUEST BY Hire a Friend).</p>
<p><strong>f. Payment Method. </strong>The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen payment method.</p>
<p><strong>g. Reaffirmation of Authorization.</strong> Your non-termination or continued use of the Service reaffirms that Hire a Friend is authorized to charge your Payment Method. Hire a Friend may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges. This does not waive Hire a Friend&rsquo;s right to seek payment directly from you. Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you initially subscribed to the Service. </p>
